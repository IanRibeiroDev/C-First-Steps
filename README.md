# C-First-Steps

The projects in this repository were made using Jetbrains's CLion IDE, which uses CMake to build its projects.

In order to execute a "main.c" file from any project, you have to make sure that the corresponding "CMakeLists.txt" file from that project's folder is also in the root folder. Right now, the __**Geometric Shapes**__ project's "CMakeLists.txt" is in the root directory.

This repository is more focused in showing my progress on learning C, rather than making actual applications, so some conventions (like proper use of header files) may be broken, as I'm still learning.
